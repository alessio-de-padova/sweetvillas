# sweetvillas
RESTFUL API Service with JPA 

In [sweetvillas.sql](https://github.com/alessio-de-padova/sweetvillas/blob/main/sql/sweetvillas.sql) you can find the ddl to create the database. It will be regularly updated.  


In order to run it, connect to the database through application.properties and you'll be fine. 

What we've achieved so far:
  - Highly configurable entities with different relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany etc.);
  - Automatic DTO validation through attributes' annotations;
  - Encryption of sensible data (user name, surname, pwd etc.);
  
 What we want to achieve:
  -  DTO - Entity conversion through a better design pattern;
  -  Whatever comes to our mind :D
